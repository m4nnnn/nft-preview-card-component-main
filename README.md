# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is my solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). This project was a great way to practice image overlays and aligning content with icons.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for interactive elements (the image overlay, the title, and the creator's name).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox for layout and icon alignment
- CSS transitions for the image overlay effect

### What I learned

This project was my first time implementing a **hover overlay**. I learned how to use `position: relative` on a container and `position: absolute` for the overlay element.
